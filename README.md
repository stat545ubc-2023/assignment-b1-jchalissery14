# Assignment B1

This is an assignment focusing on how to create a basic function. The function in this assignment is called *average_values_by_group*. It takes a dataset and groups it by a chosen variable, then finds the mean value of a chosen measure for each group. Included in this assignment are examples of how to use the function, as well as tests that show how the function works in various situations (eg. when there are NA vs no NA values, what happens if you input a non-numeric measure parameter). 

## Parameters:
1) dataset - any dataset of your choosing
2) group - the column in the dataset you wish to group it by
3) measure - the column in the dataset you want to average
       Note: The 'measure' parameter must have numeric values; the function ignores any NA values.
